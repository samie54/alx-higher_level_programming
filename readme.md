Project Task:

0. My first square
Write an empty class Square that defines a square:
You are not allowed to import any module

1. Square with size
Write a class Square that defines a square by: (based on 0-square.py)

Private instance attribute: size
Instantiation with size (no type/value verification)

2. Size validation
Write a class Square that defines a square by: (based on 1-square.py)

Private instance attribute: size
Instantiation with optional size: def __init__(self, size=0):

3. Area of a square
Write a class Square that defines a square by: (based on 2-square.py)

Private instance attribute: size
Instantiation with optional size: def __init__(self, size=0):

4. Access and update private attribute
Write a class Square that defines a square by: (based on 3-square.py)

Private instance attribute: size:
property def size(self): to retrieve it
property setter def size(self, value): to set it:
size must be an integer, otherwise raise a TypeError exception with the message size must be an integer

5. Printing a square
Write a class Square that defines a square by: (based on 4-square.py)

Private instance attribute: size:
property def size(self): to retrieve it
property setter def size(self, value): to set it:
size must be an integer, otherwise raise a TypeError exception with the message size must be an integer

6. Coordinates of a square
Write a class Square that defines a square by: (based on 5-square.py)

Private instance attribute: size:
property def size(self): to retrieve it
property setter def size(self, value): to set it:
size must be an integer, otherwise raise a TypeError exception with the message size must be an integer

7. Singly linked list
Write a class Node that defines a node of a singly linked list by:

Private instance attribute: data:
property def data(self): to retrieve it
property setter def data(self, value): to set it:
data must be an integer, otherwise raise a TypeError exception with the message data must be an integer

8. Print Square instance
Write a class Square that defines a square by: (based on 6-square.py)

Private instance attribute: size:
property def size(self): to retrieve it
property setter def size(self, value): to set it:
size must be an integer, otherwise raise a TypeError exception with the message size must be an integer

9. Compare 2 squares
Write a class Square that defines a square by: (based on 4-square.py)

Private instance attribute: size:
property def size(self): to retrieve it
property setter def size(self, value): to set it:
size must be a number (float or integer), otherwise raise a TypeError exception with the message size must be a number

10. ByteCode -> Python #5
Write the Python class MagicClass that does exactly the same as the following Python bytecode:
