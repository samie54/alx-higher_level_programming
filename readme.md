Project Tasks:

0. Simple rectangle
Write an empty class Rectangle that defines a rectangle:

You are not allowed to import any module

1. Real definition of a rectangle
Write a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle by: (based on 0-rectangle.py)

Private instance attribute: width:
property def width(self): to retrieve it
property setter def width(self, value): to set it:
width must be an integer, otherwise raise a TypeError exception with the message width must be an integer
if width is less than 0, raise a ValueError exception with the message width must be >= 0
Private instance attribute: height:
property def height(self): to retrieve it
property setter def height(self, value): to set it:
height must be an integer, otherwise raise a TypeError exception with the message height must be an integer

if width is less than 0, raise a ValueError exception with the message width must be >= 0
Private instance attribute: height:
property def height(self): to retrieve it
property setter def height(self, value): to set it:
height must be an integer, otherwise raise a TypeError exception with the message height must be an integer
if height is less than 0, raise a ValueError exception with the message height must be >= 0

10. N queens
The N queens puzzle is the challenge of placing N non-attacking queens on an NÃ—N chessboard. Write a program that solves the N queens problem.

Usage: nqueens N
If the user called the program with the wrong number of arguments, print Usage: nqueens N, followed by a new line, and exit with the status 1
where N must be an integer greater or equal to 4
If N is not an integer, print N must be a number, followed by a new line, and exit with the status 1
If N is smaller than 4, print N must be at least 4, followed by a new line, and exit with the status 1
